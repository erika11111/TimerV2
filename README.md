# TimerV2
This timer app includes all React lifecycle phases implemented using useEffect hook. The useState hook was replaced with useReducer. Created timer increments the value of the count variable by 1 every second when the start button is clicked. If the counter value changes, that value is written to localStorage, so it persists after page refresh. View app on https://timerapplicationv2.netlify.app
